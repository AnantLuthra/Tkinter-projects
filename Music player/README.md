# This is music player made with tkinter in python.

## Features
- This player is basically made for auto-control of song playing from a directory of your choise.
- If you want to change the directory from which songs are being played you can do that also.
- It will change the song after a specific time which can be changed from settings.
- This app only controls the playing of this songs not actually plays the song inside it.

## Cons
- If you might want to stop the song their is a button to do that but it will directly stop the song completly.
- It uses the windows music player to play song.
- Now many people will say that if this app doesn't play song by itself then what's the benifit of using it, so let me tell you that I made this app for my personal usage and for practice of tkinter.
